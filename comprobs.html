				<h3 class="text-center headColor"> Common Problems </h3>
				<p class="text-center">Here you can find the common problems at patients may have when going into orthodontic treatment.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="row"> <!-- first row of info-->
			<div class="col mb-2">
				<h3 class="mt-3 text-center headColor"> Overbite</h3>
				<p class="text-center"> Commonly seen throughout many patients, an overbite occurs when the top row of teeth cover too much of the bottom row of teeth when biting down. If the top row of teeth extend too far forward, the bottom row of teeth may touch the roof of the mouth and cause irritation and sores.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col mb-2">
				<h3 class="mt-3 text-center headColor"> Underbite</h3>
				<p class="text-center"> An underbite mainly occurs when the bottom row of teeth, also known as the downstairs, extend past the top row of teeth, known as the upstairs. For your child, if this problem persists, it could lead to jaw and chewing problems in the future. </p>
			</div>
		</div> <!-- end of first row -->
		
		<div class="row"> <!-- Second row of info-->
			<div class="col mb-2">
				<h3 class="mt-3 text-center headColor"> Openbite</h3>
				<p class="text-center"> With an openbite, the bottom row of teeth will not meet properly with the top row of teeth. This results in the patient not being able to bite down properly or being able to chew their food. This misalignment of teeth will provide even more dental risks because the teeth in the back of the mouth, also known as the molars, will receive lots of pressure when eating.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col mb-2">
				<h3 class="mt-3 text-center headColor"> Crossbite</h3>
				<p class="text-center"> Having a crossbite means that one or more of the upper teeth sit in front, behind, or even inside of the bottom row of teeth. This may result in conditions such as tooth stratification and misaligned jaw growth.</p>
			</div>
		<div class="row"> <!-- Third row of info-->
			<div class="col mb-2">
				<h3 class="mt-3 text-center headColor"> Crowding</h3>
				<p class="text-center">When teeth start to erupt and grow from the mouth, there may not be enough room for proper growth. Therefore, each tooth begins to push on one another during development, resulting in the teeth coming in at varying angles. This is known as crowding. In very severe cases, a tooth or two may have to be surgically removed. Otherwise, Invisalign and braces could correct this problem.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col mb-2">
				<h3 class="mt-3 text-center headColor"> Excessive Spacing</h3>
				<p class="text-center">This could occur in many different ways, like the jaw being too large to accommodate the developing teeth, impacted teeth, missing teeth, protruding teeth, or smaller than average teeth. Normally, teeth are best protected when there is not any kind of large gap between them. With large gaps, bacteria can get trapped in the pockets of gums and can increase the risk of gum disease or infection. Excessive Spacing needs to be treated immediately to prevent these problems.</p>
			</div>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="row"> <!-- Fourth row of info-->
			<div class="col mb-2">
				<h3 class="mt-3 text-center headColor"> Overjet</h3>
				<p class="text-center">Also known as an upper teeth protrusion, an overjet occurs when the front upper teeth “jet” too far forward in front of the bottom row of teeth. Unlike an overbite, an overjet/upper teeth protrusion is usually the result of bad habits such as finger sucking or tongue thrusting from early stages in life. Because these habits cause constant pressure to the front upper teeth, they will be splayed into the lips.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col mb-2">
				<h3 class="mt-3 text-center headColor"> Misaligned Midlines</h3>
				<p class="text-center">For reference, the midlines in your mouth are the two lines that form the gap between the top front teeth, also known as the incisors, and the bottom front teeth. Normally, the two midlines must be aligned to form one straight line down the middle of the mouth. With this specific problem, the midlines would not be aligned properly. Without treatment, misaligned midlines could negatively impact law growth and dental function.</p>
